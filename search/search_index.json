It is expected that the 5 points will be awarded for most peer reviews, although obviously low-quality peer reviews will receive zero points. Borderline cases may be given less than 5 points. Examples of a low-quality review are:</p> <ul> <li>Few comments on the work</li> <li>Mostly meaningless or off-the-mark comments, where it is obvious the reviewer did not properly read the work</li> <li>Contains offensive or inappropriate comments</li> </ul> <p>Examples of meaningless comments are: Nice work!, You did a good plot here!, Very good!. These may be encouraging, but they don't provide any feedback to your colleagues.
