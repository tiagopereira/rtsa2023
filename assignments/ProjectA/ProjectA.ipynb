    "In this part, you will reenact the work of Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin at Harvard. Her [1925 PhD thesis](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1925PhDT.........1P) was called \"undoubtedly the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy\" by Otto Struve. Its opening sentences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The application of physics in the domain of astronomy constitutes\n",
    "  a line of investigation that seems to possess almost unbounded\n",
    "  possibilities.  In the stars we examine matter in quantities and under\n",
    "  conditions unattainable in the laboratory.  The increase in scope is\n",
    "  counterbalanced, however, by a serious limitation - the stars are\n",
    "  not accessible to experiment, only to observation, and there is no\n",
    "  very direct way to establish the validity of laws, deduced in the\n",
    "  laboratory, when they are extrapolated to stellar conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extrapolation of terrestrial physics laws is precisely what Payne did in her thesis. She applied the newly-derived Saha distribution for different ionisation stages of an element to stellar spectra, finding that the empirical Harvard classification represents primarily a temperature scale. Her work crowned efforts of Saha, Russell, Fowler, Milne, Pannekoek and others along the same lines. It illustrates that detailed physics, in this case atomic physics, is usually needed to explain cosmic phenomena.\n",
