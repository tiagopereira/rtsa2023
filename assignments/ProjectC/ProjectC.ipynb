    "\n",
    "This project will lead you through the basics of non-LTE radiative transfer. Compared to the other two projects it is more abstract and we will not compute line profiles as detailed as in Project B, since this would require a lot of boilerplate code. The focus is instead on the numerical techniques that make solving the problem possible, and you will get to design a non-LTE scheme from scratch.\n",

    "### 1.1 The Feautrier method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Feautrier method is a way to compute intensity for a given source function and optical depth scale. It can be used for both LTE and non-LTE problems, and it approaches the radiative transport equation as a boundary-value problem. It has some limitations (e.g. cannot be used with line blends, needs additional treatment for velocities), and when used in 3D it works better for long-characteristics. For these reasons, it is often favoured to use piecewise integration methods instead. However, the Feautrier method is still particularly illustrative to interpret the $\\Lambda$ operator, so we will use it here.\n",
